1. Overriding method cannot reduce the visibility of the parent method 
2. Final method cannot be overridden 
3. Static method cannot be overridden. If a static method gets created in sub class  with the same signature, it is considered as an independent method. Does not have any connection with the parent method 
4. Child can throw any unchecked exception. NO restrictions. But checked exceptions should be narrower or same. Cannot broads the exception being thrown. 
5. Checked exceptions - those that will be checked during compile time. Can be fixed by using a try, catch block or  declaring throws in the method . Examples : File Not found , Class not found 
6. Unchecked exceptions. - These are not checked during compile time. Examples : Null pointer exceptions, ArrayIndexOut of bound 
7. When  a new object of child is created, an object of parent will not be created.
