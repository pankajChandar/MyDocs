-----------
1. Adapter 
2. Bridge 
3. Facade 
4. Decorator

6. Flyweight 

Behavioral 
-----------
1. Iterator 
2. Chain of responsibility 
3. 

concurrency 
------------
1. Balking - If the object is in an inappropriate state, then the method will not be executed. 
For example, if there are 3 threads trying to access a method and the method will execute only if a boolean state--true, then other 2 threads cannot execute this method 
2. Thread Pool  - Defines the number of threads that can work simultaneously. Tasks will be queued until a thread frees up and the freed thread will take a task from the queue 
3. async method invocation - similar to future task in java. operations will be run in parallel and the currect thread is not blocked 
4. Semaphore - Defines the number of concurrent threads to access a shared resource. example: An ATM with 4 kiosks 
5. Mutex - sepaphore with number of threads =1
