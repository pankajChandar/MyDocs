arrayList vs hashset : 
	1. No duplicates in hashset. 
	2. hashset does not maintain the order while Arraylist does.  
	3. Hashset can be looped only using an iterator. Normal for loop cannot be used 

Hash map vs linked hashmap vs TreeMap : 
    1. Hashmap does not maintain order, linked hash map maintains insertion order, TreeMap sorts the key and maintain the order . Hashcode orders the keys based on the hashcode . 
    2. Performance : hash map is faster followed by linkedhashmap , TreeMap

Comparable and Comparator : 
	1.	Implementing comparable interface in the pogo, add a compareTo method.
	2.	Create a comparator class by implementing comparator interface. Multiple variants of this calls can be created and 		used with sort accordingly.
