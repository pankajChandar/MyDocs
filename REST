JAX-RS is the java framework for restFul API. Jersey is the implementation of JAX-RS 

Idempotent : All methods except POST are idempotent(Creates the same effect even when submitted multiple times)
HATEOAS : Hypermedia as the engine of application state - this means, a link to other resources can be provided in the rest response 

security
--------
Always use HTTPS 
Prefer to hash the password 
Use OAUTH when possible 
Add timestamp in the request, this will let u decide if the request has reached within the specified time interval 
Do not expose keys, credentials in the uri 

SOAP vs REST 
------------
1. Soap is completely based on XML. Rest allows JSON.XMl,CSV and many more
2. Only basic security features are availble for REST. JAX-WS provides a luxuriuos security feature for SOAP 
3. Asynchrounous API : Rest provides good features for asyn calls. A response code with 202 and details to check back the status in future can be shared 

Caching 
--------
cache-control methods :- 
1. public - anyone like proxy servers can cache the response 
2. private - only the end client can cache the response 
3. no cache - nobody can cache the reponse 
4. no store - can be cached in memory but not in disk 

caching startegies :-
time based -  maxAge 
conditional - etag (Entity tag). if the resource has not changed, 304 code will be returned. something like the hascode of the correspondng object can be used as the etag.
